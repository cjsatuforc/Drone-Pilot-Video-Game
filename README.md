# Drone-Pilot-Video-Game
Drone pilot game created for a class assignment.

In this game, the first level has randomly generated barriers. When all three lives are lost or when the fuel runs out, the game automatically restarts and a new randomly generated first level begins. The second level also has randomly generated barriers; however, this level is meant to be harder than the first. 

I also added rocks all over the barriers for decoration. The link to these rocks is http://cdn.xl.thumbs.canstockphoto.com/canstock4370718.jpg

Have fun!
